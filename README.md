High level abstraction meant to create six degree of freedom technical animations in Blender.

This is currently a work in progress. Documentation and instructions for use are incoming, as well as new features useful for scientific visualizations!

## Installation

```bash
python -m "your/path/to/blender/python" pip install bpsci
```
#### Requirements
